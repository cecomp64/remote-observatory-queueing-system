# Remote Observatory — Queueing System

The Rails frontend and API for a remote/robotic telescope observing
queue: members pick a telescope, submit imaging targets through a guided
wizard, and track progress; admins manage telescopes and API keys; a
companion worker (see
[`remote-observatory-worker`](https://github.com/cecomp64/remote-observatory-worker))
uses the JSON API to sync targets into NINA's Target Scheduler plugin and
report progress/files back.

See [`ARCHITECTURE.md`](ARCHITECTURE.md) for the full design and API
contract, and [`docs/SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md`](docs/SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md)
for the unified-platform plan (this app as the central Hub for the worker,
`altair-pre-processor`, and the retired `astrophotography-database`).

## Requirements

* Ruby 3.3+
* PostgreSQL 14+
* Node.js (for `jsbundling-rails` / esbuild) and either `bun` or `yarn`

## Setup

```bash
bundle install
bin/rails db:create db:migrate db:seed
bin/dev            # runs Rails + esbuild + Tailwind watchers together
```

`db:seed` creates two dev accounts (both password `password123`):

* `admin@example.com` — admin
* `member@example.com` — member, with a sample in-progress target

It also creates a sample telescope with a synthetic horizon file and
prints a dev API key for it — use that key to try the API described
below (or generate a fresh one at **Admin → Telescopes → API keys**).

## Running tests

```bash
bin/rails db:test:prepare
bundle exec rspec
```

## Key areas of the app

* `app/controllers/target_wizard_controller.rb` — the multi-step,
  session-backed "new target" flow (`/targets/new` → `.../details` →
  `.../exposures` → `.../review`).
* `app/controllers/admin/` — admin-only telescope + API key management
  (`/admin`).
* `app/controllers/api/v1/` — the API the worker calls: API-key
  authenticated, scoped per telescope. See `ARCHITECTURE.md` for the
  full contract.
* `app/models/telescope.rb#horizon_points` — parses a telescope's
  uploaded horizon file (az,alt CSV) for the horizon chart on the
  telescope page.
* `app/jobs/notify_owner_job.rb` / `app/services/discord_notifier.rb` —
  email + Discord alerts fired whenever a `TargetEvent` is created
  (progress update, file published, status change).

## Configuration (ENV)

| Variable | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `APP_HOST` | Host used to build absolute URLs in production emails |
| `DISCORD_DEFAULT_WEBHOOK_URL` | Fallback Discord webhook for users who opt in but haven't set their own |
| `SJAA_MEMBERSHIP_URL` | Link shown on the profile page to the SJAA membership site |

## Notes on gem pinning

`Gemfile` pins `json` to `~> 2.9`. `json` 3.0 changed
`JSON.parse`'s arity in a way that's incompatible with how Rails 8.1's
`ActiveSupport::JSON.decode` calls it — without the pin, encrypted
session cookies fail to decrypt (`ArgumentError: wrong number of
arguments`) on every request that round-trips a session/CSRF cookie.
